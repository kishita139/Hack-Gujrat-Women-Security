Women ought to travel late at night so it becomes a prior importance for them to remain safe and alert. Unsafe street limits womenâ€™s choices in life forcing them to miss those important opportunities and moments where they can fell proud, confident and empowered.In these years many initiatives have been taken by Ministry of Women and Child Development like installation of CCTV monitors in railway stations and 24*7 monitoring, equipping phones and emergency phones and emergency helpline numbers(181) and panic buttons etc. Our contribution is circumventing this problem in through safar, a web-application which behaves like a personal safety map for women and provides simplest way to contact and get your nearest help.
The App provides the users with a safety map in which the person can find safest possible routes from a particular location to the inputted region this which we have come up with by taking certain parameters, Also we have given a SOS emergency alert button when it is triggered it sends the live location of the client to the personalised contacts the client gave while signing-up also it sends the live location alert to the users in the 500m geofenced area around the client as soon as the helper user presses ok to the alert notification she is directed to the google map where she can the route and exact distance and reach the client as the fastest.
