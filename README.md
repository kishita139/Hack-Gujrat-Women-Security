# Women-security
The App provides the women with a safety map in which they can find safest possible routes from a particular location to the inputted region this which we have come up with by taking certain parameters, Also we have given a SOS emergency alert button when it is triggered it sends the live location of the client to the personalised contacts the client gave while signing-up also it sends the live location alert to the users in the 500m geofenced area around the client as soon as the helper user presses ok to the alert notification she is directed to the google map where she can the route and exact distance and reach the client as the fastest.
